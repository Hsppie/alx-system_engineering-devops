Issues about this infrastructure
1. SPOF
No backup database
One server if it fails the whole system is down
2. Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs
to be restarted)
Downtime will be longer and that means the entire system will be down
3. Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
The system lacks a way to manage the incoming traffic, lack of a load balancer means that the
system will slow down in case of much traffic
